metro-rio-xml-json wants to provide information about the Metrô Rio system in a
machine readable format, on XML and on JSON.

Nowadays the XML schema is as simple as that:

<stations>
    <station name="STATION-NAME" code="COD" />
</stations>

but the idea is to be very specific, including: ways, lines, accessibility
(elevators and escalators), stores, subway entrances etc.
Feel free to colaborate with the XML schema itself or by adding data by
forking the project or sending an email.
